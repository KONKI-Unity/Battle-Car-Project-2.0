-- INSTRUCTIONS --

To get started simply import the three folders - one for each vehicle - into your game engine of choice.

If you are using Unity you can simply open the "Sci-Fi Vehicles" Unity Package which will set everything up for you.

Each folder contains:
	A model file (.fbx)
	A set of textures

The textures are named with:
	D: Diffuse (Albedo)
	S: Specular
	N: Normal
	AO: Ambient Occlusion
	E: Emission
	H: Height

The textures are set up for PBR rendering. In Unity that means you should use the Standard (Specular Setup) shader.

If you are unsure about how you are allowed to use the assets please see the Usage Guidelines: http://devassets.com/guidelines/
